## `<parent>`

Does the parent project version effects the dependencies' version?  
**ChatGPT-3.5:**
<div style="margin: 5px; padding: 20px; border: 2px solid orange">
Yes, in a Maven project, the version specified in the `parent` project can influence the versions of dependencies in the child project. When a project inherits from a parent project, it inherits the configuration, properties, and dependencies defined in the parent's POM file.

If a dependency version is not explicitly specified in the child project, Maven will look up the dependency in the parent project. If the dependency is defined in the parent project with a specific version, that version will be used in the child project, unless the child project explicitly overrides it.

Here's how it works:

1. **Inheriting Dependency Versions:** If a dependency is listed in the `<dependencies>` section of the parent project, and the version is specified there, the child project inherits that version unless explicitly overridden in the child project.

2. **Overriding Dependency Versions:** If the child project specifies a version for a dependency, it takes precedence over the version defined in the parent. This allows for flexibility in managing dependency versions at the project level.

In the provided Maven POM example:

```xml
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.7.4</version>
    <relativePath/>
</parent>
```

The version `2.7.4` of the Spring Boot Starter Parent is used. This means that the child project (`workshop` in this case) inherits the configurations and dependencies from the Spring Boot Starter Parent with version `2.7.4`.

If there are specific dependencies listed in the child project's `<dependencies>` section without a version specified, Maven will look to the parent project for those versions. If a dependency is not found in the parent or the version is not specified in the parent, then Maven will look in its central repository or other repositories as configured in the Maven settings.
